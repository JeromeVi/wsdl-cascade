### News Archives

NOTE: These instructions are incomplete.

The Archived News items are moved into folders in news-events/archived/yyyy-yyyy.

The index blocks should be set to alphabetical ascending for the articles to be in the correct order. Older years can't have this, as there are articles that are not named in the yyyy-mm-dd-title format.

The news-events+archived site has pages for each of the archived years. Publish these.

On the server, a simple `prince 20xx-20yy-archived-news.html` will create the appropriate PDF.

The files on the server can be moved into the relevant folders in the archived folder on the server.
