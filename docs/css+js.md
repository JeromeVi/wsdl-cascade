# CSS and JS Setup

NOTE: These instructions are outdated.

The slc.edu website uses [minify](https://code.google.com/p/minify/) to, well, minify the CSS and JS.
The site uses the groupsConfig.php to pull in groups.

The desktop sites' CSS comprises of the files in `/core/v5.0/css/a/`, which have been split up into separate files in order to make them easier to manage.

Similarly, the sites' JS files are to be found as individual files in `/core/v5.0/js/plugins`.
